## Details of webpage
Designed a 2 page website that included navigation from the navbar of the homepage (pg1) to a functional contact page (pg2). The contact form is fully functional so feel free to leave me a message!

## Server
I designed the server in Python and used PythonAnywhere to host my site.

## Database
The database stores messages from the contact page directly into a csv database on my PythonAnywhere account.
